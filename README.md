Hello, I am Boston from the SpudnikPi Space Agency and I would like to congratulate you for finding this GitHub page. Our Mission is to send Spuds into space (or just up) with this tech in these folders here you can see all of the code needed for this marvelous piece of terrestrial engineering for extraterrestrial goals. All of the code seen here will be ran on a raspberry pi. (We will use ngrok to host the html/php webpages).

Basic Information:
First start the server then Run the "Spudnik Pi - UI.py" file  (Not Full Screen) this is all the stuff needed to get it up and running.

Setup:

1. Search on Google for Nginx and set this up (with php enabled)
2. Then set up Ngrok to allow the website to be received from any network.
3. Use the "cp" or "mv" commands to move all of the files from here into the specified directory
4. Run one request from a device.
5. Run "Spudnik Pi - UI.py" - Comment out the full screen setup and comment in the not full screen
6. Run one request from a device to see it working and not erroring.
7. Run "Spudnik Pi - UI.py" - Comment out the not full screen setup and comment in the full screen
8. Run one request from a device to see it working.
9. Everything is setup

FAQ:

Why not do full screen first??

If you get an error it will crash and you will need to hard reboot
